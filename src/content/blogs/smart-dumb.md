# *How not to be a \"Smart-Dumb\" person*

*Throughout my 21 years of existence, I have met a lot of really smart people who had dumb characteristics. I will be sharing my experience in this blog. I will keep updating this blog as and when new points come to my mind.*

*Let's assume Mr. X is a smart dumb person.*

## *Being selfish*

*When an average classmate asks Mr. X for help, he thinks, 'Why should I help the dumbest person in class? What will I get in return?' Mr. X is gatekeeping his knowledge with his status. Whoever chooses to be friends with Mr. X will not be his real friend. They will have their own motivation (probably grades), and when their goal is fulfilled, they won't help Mr. X back when he is in need.*

*Whereas if Mr. X had been the smartest person in the class AND if he had had to talk to/help everyone in the class, then he would be a likeable person. Everyone will stand for Mr. X when he is in trouble. Mr. X will be the person whom people will remember even after school/university.*

*Many of my best friends weren't the smartest people in the class. But they are the best people whom I would choose to hang out with.*

## *Not doing things for the end outcome*

*Most people today do things for the end outcome. Ask a random 12th grader in India, \"Which engineering do you want to do?\" You will hear \"computer science engineering.\"\"Why do you want to do Computer Science\"\"uhhh..uhhh .…₹50 LPA package.\" It's not the student's fault. Coaching institutes and education influencers are selling promises like, \"Join our institute, and we will prepare you for JEE Advance, and your son will be able to crack a 50 LPA package from Google.\" It's the parent's fault. They are grownups. They should know if their child isn't interested in computer science, he won't be able to get a ₹50 LPA package even if Alan Turing teaches the child personally.*

*Even if the child is able to get a ₹50 LPA package, if your sole motivation was money, chances are you won't be very happy. Your 1/3rd life will be at the office. Let's say your career is about 30 years. This means 10 years straight, day and night, will be spent in the office. Would you want to give 10 years of your life doing something that you don't care about or hate?*

*I have mainly 2 achievements in my life—clearing JEE and getting a job. For both these achievements, my goal wasn't to get AIR``. During JEE, I was curious to learn more in math and physics. I was the person who knew the derivation of all formulas (for context: derivation wasn't given importance since it isn't asked in JEE). For the software engineer job, I was passionate about building some cool shit. I chose the unorthodox path to not do LeetCode at all. Many of my friends have more packages than me because they did DSA. But it doesn't matter to me. If my current job had offered me 1/2 the current salary, I would have still delivered the same level of work as I am delivering now. Why? Because I like what I am doing.*

*This mindset has helped me to rarely get burned out and enjoy work more.*

## *Not being Jealous*

*We have all been jealous at some point when our friend gets better grades or receives more appreciation from the manager. Over time, I have learned to get less jealous. Now, if any of my friends get something better than me, I am a part of their celebration. There are 8 billion people in this world. There will always be someone better than you. How many times will you be more upset than the other person that they have something that you don't? For me, life is too short to be jealous. You yourself will feel good when your friends really wish you 'best of luck' for something you are doing.*

## *Being Curious*

*I have seen some really smart people who refuse to learn anything outside the syllabus, who will not think about anything outside the syllabus, and who will not venture out to explore something outside their tech stack that is required for the job.*

*One of my biggest fears about staying here in Bangalore is that I might have surrounded myself with only tech people. I want to talk with people outside of tech—finance, medical, law, etc. Being curious has always helped me. I can't express how… but I know I have enjoyed being curious. You can fucking talk to me about anything, and I will be interested in listening to you. The only condition is that you should be passionate about the thing that you are talking about.*

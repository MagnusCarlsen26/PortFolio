# Terrible state of Indian Fresher Devs

This is going to be a long rant.

I have seen people complaining - "Mass recruiters like Infosys and TCS has their freshesr salary stagnant at 3.5-4LPA." The answer is - because you are not skilled enough. Make yourself so skillful that you tell the HR give me 10LPA or find someone else. Why don't you have balls to say that? Why will company pay you more if they can get someone else who has same skills as you but is willing to work at lower salary?
